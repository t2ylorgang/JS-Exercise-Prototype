# Constructors, Prototypes and _this_

## JavaScript Fundamentals

## Objectives

- explain the four principles of the 'this' keyword and demonstrate each explanation with an example of their uses
- describe, and use prototypes, constructor functions the new keyword, and pseudo-classical inheritance to build objects

## Introduction

In order to complete these tasks you will need your newly aquired knowledge of constructor functions, prototypes, and the `this` keyword.

## Instructions

### Task 1 - Set up Project

  1. Fork repo
  1. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!).
  1. `cd` into your newly cloned repository.
  1. Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
  1. Install dependencies by typing `npm install`.
  1. Run tests by typing `npm run test:watch`.
  1. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual.
  1. Make sure to commit often!!

### Task 2 - MVP

Find the file `index.js` and complete tasks 1, 2 and 3 until all of your tests pass.
There is an additional task 4 which requires written explanations and has no tests.

If you run into trouble while coding, fight the good fight for 20 minutes and then get on the help channel. __Remember to formulate your help request in a professional manner__ - like you would at the job - by including error messages, screenshots, and any other pertinent information about the problem, as well as what things you have attempted already while trying to solve it.

### Task 3 - Stretch 

There are stretch goals found throughout `index.js`. Do not start work on these until you have finished MVP.
